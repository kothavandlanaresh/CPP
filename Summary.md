### Summary of Important Concepts

#### Pointer and Array Arithmetic in C++
- **Pointer Arithmetic**: Allows accessing array elements using pointer arithmetic.
- **Incorrect Usage of Pointers**: Avoid printing pointer addresses instead of values.
- **Array Indexing**: Allows accessing array elements using array indexing.
- **Range-based For Loop with Array**: Allows iterating over array elements using a range-based for loop.
- **Iterating with Pointers**: Allows iterating over array elements using pointers in a traditional for loop, but pointers cannot be directly used in range-based for loops.

For detailed examples and explanations, refer to [26_pointer_array_arithmetic.md](26_pointer_array_arithmetic.md).

#### Inline, Extern, and Friend Functions in C++
- **Inline Functions**: Functions defined with the `inline` keyword to suggest to the compiler to insert the function's body where the function call is made.
- **Extern Variables**: Variables declared with the `extern` keyword to indicate that the variable is defined in another translation unit.
- **Friend Functions**: Functions declared with the `friend` keyword within a class to allow access to the class's private and protected members.

For detailed examples and explanations, refer to [01_inlie_extern_friend.md](01_inlie_extern_friend.md).
